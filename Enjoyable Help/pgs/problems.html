    <h3>
      <a name="unavailable"></a>
      When I start Enjoyable, it says "Input devices are unavailable"
    </h3>
    <p>
      This happens if Enjoyable is refused access to your input
      devices by Mac OS X. This usually happens if another application
      has requested exclusive access to them. Try quitting any other
      applications using your input devices. If that doesn't work, try
      disconnecting and reconnecting the device, then restarting
      Enjoyable. If it still doesn't work you may need to reboot.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <a name="noswitch"></a>
      Enjoyable never switches to my application mapping
    </h3>
    <p>
      Make sure it matches the name of the application exactly. If you
      still have trouble, name the mapping <kbd>@Application</kbd> and
      switch back to have Enjoyable try to deduce the correct name
      automatically.

    <h3>
      Mouse clicks and drags don't work
      <a name="brokenmouse"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a known issue with Cocoa applications, as they require
      more specially-crafted mouse events. We hope to fix it in a
      future version.
