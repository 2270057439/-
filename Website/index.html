    <p>Enjoyable is an application for Mac OS X which allows you to use
      controller inputs like a mouse or keyboard. If you've ever played a
      video game which only supports mouse and keyboard input but you want
      to use a joystick or gamepad, then Enjoyable is the program for you.</p>

    <p>To start, just press a button on your joystick or gamepad, then press
      the key you want to map it for. Then press the ▶ button and switch
      back to your game. For more details, Enjoyable has a in-application
      manual available in Help Viewer via <code>⌘?</code>.</p>
