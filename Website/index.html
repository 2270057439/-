    <p>Enjoyable is an application for Mac OS X which allows you to use
      controller inputs like a mouse or keyboard. If you've ever played a
      video game which only supports mouse and keyboard input but you want
      to use a joystick or gamepad, then Enjoyable is the program for you.</p>

    <h2><a name="requirements" href="#requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.7+</li>
      <li>One or more HID-compatible (e.g. USB or Bluetooth) input devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mappings</h2>
    <p>
      I play games with a Playstation 3 controller, so these will be
      useless if you have a different controller. These are the
      mappings I use for games I like. To use them, just save them and
      double-click on them in Finder, or use âŒ˜O in Enjoyable to import
      them.
