Enjoy2
======

Enjoy2 is a simple program for Mac OSX that allows you to transform joystick inputs into keyboard or mouse events.

If you've ever played a video game which only supports mouse and keyboard input, but you want to use a joystick or gamepad, then Enjoy2 is the program for you. Enjoy2 lets you map your joystick inputs to:

* Key events
* Mouse clicks
* Mouse movement (for analog sticks)

Enjoy2 supports multiple configurations (for different games or programs) and you can even map joystick buttons to change configurations on-the-fly.

Enjoy2 is written by [Yifeng Huang](htty://nongraphical.com) and is based on [Enjoy by Sam McCall](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/). Enjoy is MIT-licensed.
