    <p>
      You can use Enjoyable to map input to mouse buttons, moving, and
      scrolling.
    </p>

    <h3>Movement</h3>
    <p>
      Select the direction you'd like the input to move the
      mouse. Adjust the movement speed using the slider underneath.  If
      you are mapping an analog input then this is the maximum speed;
      for a button it's a constant speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed is set independently for each input. You can have
      faster horizontal movement than vertical movement, or map one
      set of inputs to a fast speed and another set to a slow
      speed.
    </p>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Select the mouse button you'd like the input to simulate.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="scrolling"></a>Scrolling</h3>
    <p>
      Simulated scrolling can be continuous like the scrolling
      gestures on a trackpad, or discrete like a mouse wheel that
      clicks as you spin it. You can simulate a vertical or horizontal
      mouse wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use <em>continuous scrolling</em> check the <b>Smooth</b>
      button and use the slider underneath the directions to adjust
      the scrolling speed. If you are mapping an analog input then
      this is the maximum speed; for a button it's a constant
      speed. Scrolling will continue as long as as the input is held
      down.
    <p>
      To use <em>discrete scrolling</em> leave the button
      unchecked. The input will trigger scrolling by exactly one line
      and stop, regardless of how long you hold the button down or how
      far you move an analog input.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrows indicate the direction you would spin a mouse wheel
      or move your fingers. Depending on settings this may mean you
      need to choose a down arrow to scroll up and vice versa. You can
      also change this globally in <b> > System Preferences… >
      Mouse</b> and <b> > System Preferences… > Trackpad</b>.
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="mouseissues"></a>Known Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Enjoyable is unable to send most mouse events to itself - the
      application will freeze until you click on it with a real mouse
      or touchpad. If you find another appliation that has problems
      with Enjoyable's mouse support <a
      href="https://github.com/joewreschnig/enjoyable/issues">please
      file a ticket in the issue tracker</a>.
